user: assuming we can get this done (see below) and please be concise, 

what's best path to configurable entities in an npm package, i'm not seeing it yet, just give me a one liner or on the high level implementation, do you understand ?

answer:
Yes. High-level: accept a config object during package initialization that defines entity types and their URL path logic, then use that config throughout generation/resolution functions.

ts:
const longurl = new LongURL({ entities: ['post', 'user', 'product'] });

This enables full flexibility while keeping the API simple.

user: so can install package and use in codebase to manage backend urls, that's slick ?

answer: Exactly — that’s the whole magic. You `npm install longurl`, configure your entity types once, and now your backend can:

* 🔗 Generate clean, secure, structured URLs for any entity
* 🔁 Resolve short URLs back to real records
* 📊 Optionally track clicks or metadata
* 🧩 Fit directly into your existing DB and API logic

It’s **infra-as-code for URLs** — slick, powerful, and dev-native.
