**Yes, this is WAY too much for a weekend launch.**

## Reality Check for MVP Scale

**YC/indie hacker teams typically have:**
- 1K-100K total URLs across all entity types
- Maybe 1M URLs if they become hugely successful

**Your current 6-character Base62:**
- 56.8 billion combinations
- Collision probability at 100K URLs: ~0.000001%
- This is a non-problem for your target market

## What Actually Matters for Weekend Launch

**Collision handling you need:**
```typescript
// Simple retry with database constraint
try {
  await save(urlId, data);
} catch (uniqueConstraintError) {
  // Regenerate and try once more
  urlId = generateNewId();
  await save(urlId, data);
}
```

**That's it.** 

## The Premature Optimization Trap

This analysis is exactly what kills weekend launches:
- **"What if we get to 100 million URLs?"** 
- **"What about enterprise scale?"**
- **"We need distributed ID generation!"**

**Your users' actual problems:**
- "Does npm install work?"
- "Can I shorten a URL in 3 lines of code?"  
- "Does it handle basic errors gracefully?"

## Ship the Simple Version

**Current collision handling is fine if:**
- Database has unique constraint on `url_id`
- You retry once on collision
- You throw clear error after retry fails

**Save the enterprise analysis for when:**
- You have 1000+ active users
- Someone actually hits collision issues
- Companies are paying you money

**Right now:** Ship it, get feedback, iterate based on real usage patterns.

The collision analysis is great technical thinking, but it's solving tomorrow's problems instead of today's user adoption challenge.
