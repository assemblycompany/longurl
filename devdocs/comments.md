user: can we remove having to support db or is that necessary, like have support for db schema included postgress, mongodb, firestore, etc, 



The **universal adapter pattern** is powerful, but here are the main drawbacks to be aware of:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Drawbacks**

1. **Increased complexity**

   * You introduce abstraction layers that can confuse new users.
   * More code paths = more testing, especially with different DBs.

2. **Inconsistent feature support**

   * Not all databases support the same things (e.g., triggers, upserts, transactions).
   * You'll need to handle edge cases or limit feature sets per adapter.

3. **Performance variability**

   * In-memory is fast; remote DBs like Firestore can be slower and less predictable.
   * May affect real-time use cases unless caching is baked in.

4. **Higher maintenance burden**

   * Supporting Postgres, MongoDB, Firestore means writing, testing, and maintaining multiple integrations.
   * Bugs or breaking changes in one adapter don‚Äôt affect others ‚Äî but require manual catching.

5. **Harder onboarding for contributors**

   * Open-source devs must learn the adapter interface before contributing anything meaningful.

---

### ‚úÖ Worth It If:

* You keep **one in-memory + one real adapter** to start (e.g., Supabase).
* You design the interface clearly and **encourage community-contributed adapters**.

Keep core small, extensibility clean. That's the win.

user: postgresql/supabase is same adapter or different ?


**PostgreSQL and Supabase can use the same adapter** ‚Äî with minimal conditional logic ‚Äî because:

* Supabase **is PostgreSQL under the hood**
* It exposes standard Postgres via SQL or REST
* Most features (e.g., `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPSERT`) map directly

---

### ‚úÖ Best Approach

**Create a `PostgresAdapter`**, then:

* Use it directly for Postgres (via `pg` or `node-postgres`)
* Use it in Supabase by configuring with Supabase's connection string or REST client

If you want to support **Supabase features like RLS or auth**, you can add a **`SupabaseAdapter`** later as a wrapper or extension ‚Äî but not necessary at launch.

So: **start with one shared adapter**, and evolve only if Supabase-specific needs arise.

user: there's more demand for supabase with startups than established players


Absolutely ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a powerful dev UX move. Just document a simple adapter interface and show one plug-and-play example.

### üß© Example: Plugging a Custom Adapter

```ts
import { LongURL, StorageAdapter } from 'longurl'

// 1. Define your custom adapter
class MyCustomAdapter implements StorageAdapter {
  async save(id, data) { /* write to your store */ }
  async resolve(id) { /* retrieve original data */ }
  async exists(id) { /* check for collisions */ }
}

// 2. Pass it into LongURL
const longurl = new LongURL({
  adapter: new MyCustomAdapter(),
  entities: ['post', 'user']
})
```

### üìÑ In Docs:

````md
## Custom Storage

Want to use Redis, DynamoDB, or something weird?  
Just implement the `StorageAdapter` interface:

```ts
interface StorageAdapter {
  save(id: string, data: EntityData): Promise<void>;
  resolve(id: string): Promise<EntityData | null>;
  exists(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
````

Then pass it in when you create your LongURL instance.

```

This makes your package look professional, flexible, and enterprise-ready ‚Äî all while staying dead simple.
