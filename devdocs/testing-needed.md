You're absolutely right to question this! Let me double-check if `getUrlsByEntity` might actually be implemented somewhere I missed, and also verify what we can actually test.

You're absolutely right! Let me check the LongURL class more carefully to see if there's a `getUrlsByEntity` method I missed:

Read file: src/index.ts

Read file: src/index.ts
Perfect! Now I can confirm: **`getUrlsByEntity` is definitely NOT implemented**. The LongURL class only has these methods:

## ✅ **Actually Implemented Methods:**
1. `constructor(config?)`
2. `initialize()`
3. `shorten(entityType, entityId, url, metadata?)`
4. `resolve(urlId)`
5. `analytics(urlId)`
6. `close()`
7. `healthCheck()`

## ❌ **Missing Method:**
- `getUrlsByEntity(entityType, entityId)` - **Not implemented anywhere**

You're also right about testing! Let me run a quick test to see what actually works:

```bash
npm test
```
Great! The tests pass (14/14) but reveal some important insights:

## 🧪 **Test Coverage Analysis:**

**✅ Well-tested:**
- `generator.ts` - 100% coverage (URL ID generation works)
- `resolver.ts` - 90% coverage (URL resolution works)

**❌ Not tested at all (0% coverage):**
- `index.ts` - **The main LongURL class is untested!**
- `SupabaseAdapter.ts` - **The adapter is untested!**
- `cli.ts` - CLI tools untested

**🔍 What this means:**
- The **core building blocks** (generator, resolver) work well
- The **main LongURL class** that users interact with is **completely untested**
- We don't know if `analytics()`, `shorten()`, `resolve()` actually work end-to-end
- The **Supabase adapter** is untested

## 📝 **Updated Assessment:**

You're absolutely right to question this! Here's the honest status:

**✅ CONFIRMED WORKING (tested):**
- URL ID generation with collision detection
- URL resolution logic
- Base62 encoding/validation

**❓ CLAIMED BUT UNTESTED:**
- `longurl.shorten()` - **No integration tests**
- `longurl.analytics()` - **No integration tests** 
- `longurl.resolve()` - **No integration tests**
- Supabase adapter - **No tests at all**
- Real-time subscriptions - **No tests**
- Batch operations - **No tests**

**❌ DOCUMENTED BUT MISSING:**
- `getUrlsByEntity()` - **Doesn't exist**

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**

The new README I created is actually **still too optimistic**! We should be even more conservative since the main LongURL class is completely untested. 

Should I create an even more honest version that reflects the actual tested vs untested status?
